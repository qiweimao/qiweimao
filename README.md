# Let's bring sensors to the clound ☁️
Hi, I'm Qiwei Mao, a geotechnical engineer with a passion for IoT systems. I'm exploring low-power microcontrollers and LoRa communication systems to enable both hobbyist remote monitoring solutions and industrial-grade monitoring or control systems.

**Hardware I'm exploring**: ESP32, Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi, LoRa Transceivers.
