# Let's bring sensors to the cloud ☁️
Hi, I'm Qiwei Mao, a geotechnical engineer based in Atlanta GA, with a passion for IoT systems. I'm exploring low-power microcontrollers and LoRa communication systems to enable both hobbyist remote monitoring solutions and industrial-grade monitoring or control systems.

**Hardware**: [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32), Arduino UNO, Raspberry Pi, [LoRa Transceivers](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-connect/sx1276).

**Tech Stack**: NLP | Linux | AWS | React | RTOS
